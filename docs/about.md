This is the course homepage for the MSc course 
<a href="https://kurser.ku.dk/course/ndak12006u">Computational Methods in Simulation</a> given
at the Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). The
course was prepared by Professor Kenny Erleben, Associate Professor Melanie Ganz and
Associate Professor Francois Lauze. The course structure is 8 weeks with one and a half
days of mixed interactive classes and lectures per week and includes 4 hand-ins.

Check out:

* Overview of [topics]({{ '/topics' | relative_url }}) that we cover in this course
* Information about how to run our [Jupyter notebooks]({{ '/notebooks' | relative_url }})
* All the [slides]({{ '/slides' | relative_url }}) used in this course
* [Exercises]({{ '/exercises' | relative_url }}) for each week will support you in getting hands on experience with the material. 

<h2>For teachers:</h2>
If you would like to use our course material for you own teaching and need teachers solutions then please feel free to reach out to <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/110537">Professor Kenny Erleben</a>. 

<h2>For students:</h2>
<h3>Online students</h3>
Since this course is fully open, you are more than welcome to follow along. Unfortunately quizzes cannot be taken at this point, but they mostly check background knowledge. Exercises can be followed along using the provided Jupyter notebooks, but they will not be graded.

<h3>UCPH students</h3>
Registered students at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) can physically participate and receive ECTS credits for this course. Therefore, they will need to fill out quizzes and submit their exercise hand-ins through the UCPH system, 
<a href="https://absalon.ku.dk/courses/80720">Absalon</a>. See the [exercise page]({{ '/exercises' | relative_url }}) for more information.

<h4>Textbook:</h4>
<p>We do not have a single textbook in this course. Instead slides and notes are
available on <a href="{{ '/slides' | relative_url }}">[this page]</a>. The slides
make references to textbooks, scientific papers and software that we strongly
encourage students to read and investigate themselves.</p>

<h4>Flipped Classroom Teaching</h4>
The physical version of this course is designed as a flipped classroom course - what does this mean?
<p>The course is structured as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There are no formal lectures, we may present short overviews of topics as we go along.</li>
    <li>You will have to work in groups throughout all hours, teachers will be coaching and mentoring you during class hours.</li>
    <li>Video screencasts where the teachers present theory from the syllabus slides will be distributed through this website.</li>
    <li>Slide material, notes, and exercises will also be distributed through this course web page.</li>
    <li>Online quizzes will be available through Absalon.</li>
    <li>All questions regarding slides, programming, hand-ins, the syllabus, and other direct course-related content must be asked during class hours. E-mails will in general be ignored if questions belong to the class hours.</li>
    <li>Students will be divided into random workgroups every week.</li>
    <li>Weekly exercises in Jupyter notebooks will be distributed on the
<a herf="{{ '/exercises' | relative_url }}">[exercises page]</a> to help
students with programming exercises and support students in making their
bi-weekly hand-ins. The hand ins need to be submitted through Absalon. See
the <a herf="{{ '/exercises' | relative_url }}">[exercises page]</a> for details.</li>
    <li>All hand-in deadlines are strict. Students are allowed to hand in early; the TA will provide
written feedback on hand-ins. We will try and have feedback available no later than one week
after the respective hand-in deadline.</li>
    <li>Students are allowed to work together but hand-ins are individual and we will check for plagiarism.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Weekly Layout:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Prepare for Monday by reading during Friday and the weekend.</li>
    <li>Continue to work in your study group on Tuesday to increase deep learning of the theory.</li>
    <li>Plan for Wednesday so you know what problems to ask your teacher about.</li>
    <li>Use Thursday and Friday to polish your bi-weekly hand-in, and add theory to the practical
work you did during Wednesday's classes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The class schedule is roughly as follows:</p>
